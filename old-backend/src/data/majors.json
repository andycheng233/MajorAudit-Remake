Students in the department explore the historical, cultural, political, economic, and social development of Black Atlantic societies. Majors work to become informed thinkers who are intellectually prepared to offer clarity and insight to ongoing academic and public debates centered in questions concerning race and inequality.\n\nAfrican American Studies majors become knowledgeable about the history, primary methodologies, and interdisciplinary breadth of the field. Students learn to critique, articulate, analyze, and interpret universal themes concerning both individuals in society and group interactions as they relate to the work of scholars, scientists, writers, artists, musicians, economists, and entrepreneurs.",

As a foundation, students in the program gain cross-disciplinary exposure to Africa. In the junior and senior years, students develop analytical ability and focus their studies on research in a particular discipline such as anthropology, art history, history, languages and literature, political science, or sociology, or on topics such as global health, economic development, or human rights.\n\nAfrican Studies provides training of special interest to those considering admission to graduate or professional schools or careers in education, journalism, law, management, medicine, politics, psychology, international relations, creative writing, or social work. The interdisciplinary structure of the program offers students an opportunity to satisfy the increasingly rigorous expectations of admissions committees and prospective employers for a broad liberal arts perspective that complements specialized knowledge of a field.",

Through the selection of curated courses, each student develops a focus for coursework in the major. The program encourages scholarly work in nontraditional combinations of disciplines; at the same time, however, it assumes and requires a substantial foundation of knowledge in the history and culture of the United States. Students interested in the major are encouraged to consult with the director of undergraduate studies (DUS) as early as possible.",

      "about": "Anthropology is the study of human cultural, social, and biological diversity from the distant past to the present day and around the world. The undergraduate major in Anthropology introduces students to key topics and approaches in three broad areas, also known as subfields: (1) the evolution of human and nonhuman primates, including the evolutionary biology of living people; (2) the archaeological study of human societies and cultures; (3) social, cultural, and linguistic dimensions of human life. In addition to gaining a broad understanding of these complementary areas of Anthropology, majors develop advanced skills in one or more subfields and may elect to pursue a formal concentration in archaeological, biological, or sociocultural anthropology, or in medical anthropology and global health (see Concentrations). Whatever their path through the major, students learn ways of understanding and engaging with humanity that emerge from the sciences, social sciences, and humanities, and they often complete synergistic coursework in other departments and programs. All students write a senior essay, often based on independent research, and many go on to careers that incorporate anthropological perspectives.",
